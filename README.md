# bowling-kata-playground
Just a little playground to try different approaches for the bowling kata.

This repo is just to save my state sometimes when I came up with an interesting approach.

The rules for the bowling-kata can be read here:

## Tech Stack
Kata and tests are using JavaScript / TypeScript and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
